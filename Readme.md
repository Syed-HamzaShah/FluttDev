# Flutter Dev Playground

Welcome to my **Flutter Development Playground** 🚀  
This is my personal repository where I explore, practice, and experiment with Flutter & Dart.  
Anything related to Flutter that I’m learning, testing, or building will live here — from small widgets and UI experiments to complete mini-projects.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Practice Flutter concepts and best practices.
- Experiment with different state management techniques.
- Explore UI/UX ideas, animations, and widgets.
- Build mini-projects and prototypes while learning.

---

### 📖 Learning Focus

Some of the areas I’ll be exploring include:

Flutter basics (widgets, layouts, navigation)

State management (Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, etc.)

Animations & UI/UX design

Local storage (Hive, SQLite, SharedPreferences)

API integration (REST, GraphQL)

Clean architecture & best practices

### 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily my personal practice repo, but if you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or PR. Collaboration is always welcome ✨
